## Overview

MThe processed environmental information can then be used for many purposes. In Module 2, we designed tools for the characterization of the macro-environmental variations, which can also be done across different time intervals of crop growth and development (when associated with a crop) or fixed time intervals (to characterize locations). The environmental characterization toolbox (green toolbox in Fig. 1) involves two types of profiling:

* 1)	Discovering environmental types (envirotypes, hereafter abbreviated as ETs) and how frequently they occur at each growing environment (location, planting date, year). Based on the ET-discovering step, it is possible to create environmental profiles and group environments with the same ET pattern. This step is also useful for running exploratory analysis, e.g., to discover the main ET of planting dates at a target location.

* 2)	Gathering environmental covariables (hereafter abbreviated as ECs) from point-estimates (e.g., mean air temperature, cumulative rainfall). These ECs can be used for many purposes, from a basic interpretation of GÃ—E to estimating gene-environment interactions. At the end of this process, a matrix of ECs (W) is created and integrated with tools from Module 3. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25282742/131205349-b76d2b60-55ce-4f77-a6a0-247ed32b1ed5.png)
