Finally, the information from Module 2 can be used to create environmental similarity and integrate robust GP platforms for multiple environments, hereafter referred to as envirotype-informed GPs. Module 3 (the dark purple boxes Figure 1) aims to provide tools to compute environmental similarity using correlations or Euclidean distances across different trials conducted on ECs. Thus, we developed a function to integrate this enviromic source in GP as an additional source of variation to bridge the gap between genomic and phenotypic variation. For that, we provide at least four different structures into a flexible platform to integrate multiple genomic and enviromic kinships.
